        # We can try running the actual tutorial but it takes time.
        # Just checking if the script starts is good enough for CI usually, 
        # unless we want full integration test.
        # Let's run a very small clustering if possible via direct python call in pytest?
        # But we don't have small test data easily accessible without unpacking.
